Build status (just the Javascript): [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mthmulders/lin2go.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mthmulders/lin2go)

## What is it?
lin2go is an experiment to write a simple game using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
Aside from React Native, it uses [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) for the logic and state management.

## Running on iOS
Issue `react-native run-ios` or open `ios/lin2go.xcodeproj` in Xcode and hit the Run button.
The _dev_ menu can be accessed by pressing `Cmd+D` in the emulator.

## Running on Android
Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected and issue `react-native run-android`.
The _dev_ menu can be accessed by pressing `Cmd+M` in the emulator.
